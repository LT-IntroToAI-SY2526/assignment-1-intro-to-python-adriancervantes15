MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
[Copy the AI-generated problems into your `a1.py` file. Include the original prompt you used and the problems the AI created.
I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have some experience with java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover: 
> - Variables and basic data types
> - Conditionals (if/elif/else)
> - Loops (for and while)
> - Functions
> - Basic list operations
 
> Make them progressively more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs.

Problem 1: Favorite Number (Variables & Data Types)

Difficulty: ðŸŸ¢ Beginner
Concepts: Variables, strings, integers, input/output

Instructions:
Write a program that asks the user for their name and favorite number. Then, print a message using both.

Example:

Input:
Enter your name: Alex
Enter your favorite number: 7

Output:
Hi Alex! Your favorite number is 7.

user_Name = input("Enter your name:")
user_favNum = input("Enter your favorite number:")
print("Hi " + user_Name + "! Your favorite number is " + user_favNum + ".")


âœ… Problem 2: Odd or Even? (Conditionals)

Difficulty: ðŸŸ¢ Beginner
Concepts: Conditionals, modulus operator

Instructions:
Write a program that asks the user for a number and tells them whether it is odd or even.

Example:

Input:
Enter a number: 14

Output:
14 is even.

Input:
Enter a number: 5

Output:
5 is odd.

user_Num = input("Enter a number: ")
if user_Num % 2 == 1:
    print(user_Num + "is odd.")
else:
    print(user_Num + "is even.")

âœ… Problem 3: Countdown Timer (Loops: while)

Difficulty: ðŸŸ¡ Easy-Medium
Concepts: while loops

Instructions:
Write a program that takes a number from the user and counts down to 0, printing each number.

Example:

Input:
Enter a number to start countdown: 5

Output:
5
4
3
2
1
0

user_Num = input("Enter a number to start countdown: )


âœ… Problem 4: Sum of Numbers (Loops: for)

Difficulty: ðŸŸ¡ Easy-Medium
Concepts: for loops, range, summation

Instructions:
Write a program that asks for a number n and prints the sum of all numbers from 1 to n.

Example:

Input:
Enter a number: 5

Output:
The sum from 1 to 5 is 15.

âœ… Problem 5: Grade Checker (Functions + Conditionals)

Difficulty: ðŸŸ¡ Medium
Concepts: Functions, conditionals, return values

Instructions:
Write a function get_letter_grade(score) that returns a letter grade based on the numeric score:

90+ â†’ A

80â€“89 â†’ B

70â€“79 â†’ C

60â€“69 â†’ D

<60 â†’ F

Ask the user for a score, call the function, and print the result.

Example:

Input:
Enter your test score: 83

Output:
Your grade is: B
